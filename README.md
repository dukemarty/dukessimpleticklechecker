# SimpleTIckleChecker

Tool to check for tasks to be activated in the GTD understanding of a tickle file.

The idea is to manage a dedicated folder, where each subfolder serves as a single tickle element. By applying a simple naming scheme to the subfolders, the STIC tool can check which folders are up and an optional text file in the subfolder can provide additional descriptions and informations.
